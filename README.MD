# BaK GL

![GCC 11 Build Status](https://github.com/xavieran/BaKGL/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

Modern implementation of Betrayal at Krondor using OpenGL for true 3D graphics.

Main goals are to get the game running (graphics, world exploration, combat, and eventually story).

Reuses much of the original work of xbak (http://xbak.sourceforge.net/) but I am rewriting/replacing some xbak functionality as necessary.

A fair amount of progress has been made beyond xbak in deciphering the 3D data storage format so far.

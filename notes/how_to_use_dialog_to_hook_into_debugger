Before clicking on something that triggers dialog
> bpint 21 *
then click
dosbox will stop
> bpdel *
remove the existing ints.
continue until you get into the dialog key finding loop. (e.g. ovrl 3dc7, 3b52)
> bp ovrl:1b4 (1b4 is finished finding key)
step out of that function into "RunDialog" (ovrl:1427)
then
> bp ovrl:2771
This will get you to the end of the dialog
Then you will be in whatever code called run dialog
e.g. for picklocking
>bp overl2:210

heal: 3be6, heal ovrl: 47a0

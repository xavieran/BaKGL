Before clicking on something that triggers dialog


> bpint 21 *
then click
dosbox will stop
> bpdel *
remove the existing ints.
continue until you get into the dialog key finding loop. (e.g. ovrl 3dc7, 3b52)
you may need to set a BP at (42c4:014D) if the game keeps dropping 
straight back to running which it seems to do sometimes

> bp ovrl:1b4 (1b4 is finished finding key)
step out of that function into "RunDialog" (ovrl:1427)
then
> bp ovrl:2771
This will get you to the end of the dialog
Then you will be in whatever code called run dialog
e.g. for picklocking
>bp overl2:210

heal: 3be6, heal ovrl: 47a0

2b50:4df0 -> character list for dialogs...
who is magician, soldier, etc.

Set a memory breakpoint on 2b50:4df2, this is the character list and
may be easier to hook into then interrupts

bpm 2b50:4df2
then bp 3b52:2649

bpm 2b50:3d92 - current time
bpm 2b50:3d96 - current time
